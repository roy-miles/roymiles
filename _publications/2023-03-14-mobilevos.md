title: "MobileVOS: Real-Time Video Object Segmentation Contrastive Learning meets Knowledge Distillation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-14-mobilevos
excerpt: '– Introduced a novel method for semi-supervised video object segmentation on mobile devices, using a
unification of representation distillation and contrastive learning.
– Achieved competitive performance despite running up to ×5 faster, and with ×32 fewer parameters.
– This work has been accepted for presentation at CVPR 2023.'
