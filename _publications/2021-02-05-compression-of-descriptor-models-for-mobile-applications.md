excerpt: 'In this paper we demonstrate the accuracy/performance tradeoffs of applying various factorisation and networks compression methods on CNN models used for local feature extraction. We have proposed a novel Convolution-DepthwisePointwise (CDP) layer that consists of a partitioned low and
full rank decomposition of the weights that matches the naturally emergent structure of the pre-trained weights. The
allocated dense connectivity for a subset of the input features
helps maintain the top-end descriptor accuracy. We further
demonstrate the generalisability of this idea onto large architectures, namely the SuperPoint model. In both cases, we
are able to compress the models significantly, with minimal
to no accuracy degradation'
