excerpt: 'We present an efficient alternative to the convolutional layer using cheap spatial transformations. 
This construction exploits an inherent spatial redundancy of the learned convolutional filters to enable a much greater parameter efficiency, while maintaining the top-end accuracy of their dense counter-parts. 
Training these networks is modelled as a generalised pruning problem, whereby the pruned filters are replaced with cheap transformations from the set of non-pruned filters.'
