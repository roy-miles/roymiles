excerpt: 'In this paper, we proposed the use of spatial basis filters
which provides a natural extension of the standard pruning
pipeline. Instead of zeroing out the pruned filters, they are
replaced with cheap spatial transformations from the remaining non-pruned filters. These trained SBF networks are able
to achieve comparable or improved results on the image
classification task across a range of datasets and architectures.'
