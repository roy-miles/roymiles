Hi! I am a PhD student in the [department of Electronic and Electrical engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) at Imperial College London under the supervision of [Professor Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s1IAWfgAAAAJ). My work is primarily on the topic of knowledge distillation and pruning for training small and efficient computer vision models.
